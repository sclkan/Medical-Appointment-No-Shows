# Medical Appointment No-Shows Analysis
Taken from Kaggle, this dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

In this project, we will look for variables that could affect no-show rates. We will be addressing questions such as:

1. Whether certain neighborhoods have higher no-show rates
2. Whether certain age-group has a tendency to no-show
3. Whether Brazilian welfare plans have any impact on no-show rates
4. Whether SMS reminders affect no-show rates
